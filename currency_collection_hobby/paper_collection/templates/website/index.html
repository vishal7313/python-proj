    <h2>Welcome to My World of Currency</h2>
    <p>
        Hello and thanks for visiting! I'm a passionate collector of
        world and united state currencies -
        from modern banknotes to historic paper money. 
        What started as a childhood curiosity has turned into a lifelong
        pursuit of culture, history, and design captured in every note.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've built this site to showcase my collection,
        track my progress, and connect with fellow enthusiasts.
        Each note here represents a piece of
        a country's identity and heritage.
